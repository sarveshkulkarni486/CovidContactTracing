COVID Contact Tracing App
Overview
The COVID Contact Tracing App is a mobile application designed to contribute to the global effort in combating the spread of COVID-19. Leveraging contact tracing technology.
Features
. GPS enablement: which will notify every user about patient using gps.
. Testing Center Locator: Integrated map feature to help users find nearby COVID-19 testing centers.
. Authority: Authority is given to admin (hospital staff) which has all the access.

Idea: 
As this app has a feature about authority which means if any patient gets affected by covid then their data like address, name etc would be saved to database which is hosted on cloud that is firebase,
As arogya setu app is already there then why this app. First of all all the authority means to admin means no vulnerable data would get entered only valid and authentic data would get entered and it would ease to track,
and handle patient and also real data would get entered.
